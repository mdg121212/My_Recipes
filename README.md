#My Recipes

A recipe app that allows you to create recipes from scratch, or search the Spoonacular API for recipes and save them to your personal recipe database. All recipes, whether found via the API or created, can be viewed, edited, and deleted once saved.  The spoonacular api can be searched, and the personal database can be searched as well.


This app uses:
- Room for the local database.
- Retrofit2 for the api calls.
- Glide for image loading.
- Kotlin coroutines
