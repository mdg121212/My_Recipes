# My_Recipes
A recipe app that allows you to create recipes from scratch, or search the Spoonacular api for recipes and save them to your recipe database.  All recipes whether found
via the api or created, can be viewed, edited, and deleted once saved. Uses Room for the local database, Retrofit2 for the api calls, and Glide for image loading.
